# Selecting from the most popular servers
{: #bm-select-popular-servers}

The servers in the Most Popular Servers list are preconfigured to meet the needs of most client use cases, and they are ready to run in 30 - 40 minutes after you order them.
1. Open the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog ![External link icon](../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/){: new_window}.   
2. Select Bare Metal Server.
3. Click Continue.  If you do not see a Continue button, you may need to log in.
2. In the {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} section, select the following information:

| Field | Value |

| Quantity | Use the + and - icons to specify the number of identical servers to provision. The default is 1. If you want to provision multiple servers with different specifications, you need to provision them separately. |
| Billing type | Select Hourly or Monthly |
| Hostname and Domain | These fields are populated with default values. You can change them. |
| Location | Select the region where you want the server to be located. Using the drop down list, select and data center in the region. |

3. In the Storage Disks section, the Storage Disk is already selected for your Popular servers selection. Expand the Add-ons section if you want to add IBM Cloud Backup to your server.
4. In the Network Interface section, select the Uplink Port Speeds. Expand the Add-ons section to select the appropriate options or use the default values. For more information about network options, see [Network options](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-network-options).
4.  Review your order.
4. If you have a promo code to apply to your order, expand Apply Promo Code.  
5.  Review any third-party service agreements that are listed and click the **Third-Party Service Agreement** check box.
6.  Click **Provision**. You are redirected to a screen with your provisioning order number. You can print the screen because it's also your provisioning order receipt.

 A series of emails are sent to your administrator: Acknowledgment of the provisioning order, provisioning order approval and processing, and provisioning complete.

 The _provisioning complete email_ includes a link to your *Device Details* page so that you can log in to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can also log directly in to the {{site.data.keyword.slportal}}.

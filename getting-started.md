{{site.data.keyword.baremetal_long}} are single-tenant physical servers that provide you performance and control with low-level access to the hardware resources. Your server isn’t shared with “noisy neighbors,” it’s all yours!

To watch technical experts walk through common use cases, highlight features and capabilities, or take a product tour, see <a href=“https://www.ibm.com/demos/collection/IBM-Cloud-Bare-Metal-Servers“>IBM Cloud bare metal server overview</a>

   <td>3. Determine your workload specifications</td>
   <td>Before your provision your server, determine how it will be used and the server size you need to be successful. For example, do you intend to use it for development and testing, or production? Are you testing a user experience, processing lengthy algorithms, backing up and restoring data, or increasing latency speed?</td>

<tr>   
   <td>6. Provision your server</td>
   <td>You have three options when it comes to provisioning your server: fast provisioning, custom, and SAP-certified. fast provisioning servers are pre-configured servers that meet the needs of most customers and can be ready to configure 30 - 40 minutes after provisioning.


<br>Custom servers are servers that you create by selecting specific compute, connectivity, storage, and network options to meet your needs. Custom servers take longer to provision, usually 2 - 4 hours, and have higher operating costs. You can [Provision an Intel Optane-compatible bare metal server](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-provision-optane-server) or one with an [Intel SGX architecture](/docs/bare-metal?topic=bare-metal-bm-server-provision-sgx).

<br>SAP-certified servers are certified to support SAP HANA and SAP NetWeaver landscapes.
Use the links to be taken to provisioning information for that type of server. Note that with SAP-certified servers, you need to select which type of landscape, SAP HANA, or SAP NetWeaver, you are provisioning.<br>
